      <h2>Replace Batteries</h2>
      <p>
        Swap out the batteries with a fresh set. Mixing old and new batteries can prevent the remote from powering on.
      </p>

      <h2>For Rechargeable Remotes</h2>
      <p>
        Plug the remote into a USB charger. A blinking status light means it is charging. Allow up to 2 hours.
      </p>

      <h2>Inspect Battery Terminals</h2>
      <p>
        Look for corrosion or debris on the battery contacts. Clean gently with a dry cotton swab.
